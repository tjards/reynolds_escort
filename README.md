# Reynolds Rules of Flocking **Note: discontinued and incorporated into larger project here: https://github.com/tjards/swarming_sim**This project implements Reynolds Rules of Flocking (or *Boids*), which is based on a balance between three steering forces:- **Cohesion**: the tendency to steer towards the center of mass of neighbouring agents- **Alignment**: the tendency to steer in the same direction as neighbouring agents- **Separation**: the tendency to steer away from neighbouring agents Reynolds (1987) did not provide equations for the steering forces above, so we have taken some artistic liberty and had a bit of fun. In the results section, you will see variations on how "neighbours" are defined. We demonstrate free flocking and flocking to escort (i.e. following a reference). A more formal definition and analysis of flocking was provided by Olfati-Saber (2006), which we have implemented [here](https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network).## CitingThe code is opensource but, if you reference this work in your own reserach, please cite me.
